nFrame Form Builder

This is a custom form builder for use in Rails.  It makes creating consistent forms easy.

It implements forms in the way that we at nFrame prefer to implement forms.  This basically means most elements look something like the following:

<p>
  <label for="some_element">Some Element</label>
  <input type="text" id="some_element" name="some[element]" />
</p>

Install
